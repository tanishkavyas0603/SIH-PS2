Build a full-stack web application called AI-Powered DPR Quality Assessment & Risk Prediction System. The application should be production-ready, error-free, and deployable.

üîπ Tech Stack

Frontend: ReactJS + TailwindCSS (modern, clean, responsive, dashboard-style UI).

Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask).

Database: PostgreSQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM).

AI/NLP Models: HuggingFace Transformers (for NLP), scikit-learn or XGBoost (for ML risk scoring), SHAP for Explainable AI.

Geospatial: Integrate LeafletJS or Mapbox for interactive maps.

Deployment: Should be deployable on Replit or Docker-ready.

üîπ Core Features
1. DPR Upload & Processing

Allow users to upload DPRs in PDF, Word, or text.

Extract structured data using OCR + NLP (Tesseract for OCR, Transformers for NLP).

Store extracted data in the PostgreSQL database.

2. AI Quality Scoring

Implement a scoring engine that evaluates DPRs on: Completeness, Feasibility, Financial Viability, Risk Assessment.

Generate a Quality Score (0‚Äì100).

Show Explainable AI output (use SHAP/LIME to explain why score is low).

3. Geospatial Validation

Integrate GIS maps to validate DPR claims.

Example: If DPR says ‚Äúroad length = 50 km in hilly terrain‚Äù, cross-check with map data.

Show heatmaps (green, yellow, red) for risk zones.

4. Fraud & Duplication Detector

Detect copy-paste/plagiarism between DPRs.

Highlight suspicious text in red directly inside the PDF preview.

Flag inflated budgets or duplicate contractors.

5. WOW Element ‚Üí Predictive Risk Simulation

Build a Digital Twin Simulator:

Let officials run ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios.

Example: If material cost ‚Üë 20%, show new project cost & risk score.

If monsoon delay occurs, show timeline extension.

Present results via interactive graphs and timelines (use Chart.js or Recharts).

üîπ User Interface (Impressive & Modern)

Landing Page: Hero section with project title, brief tagline, and "Upload DPR" button.

Dashboard (after upload):

Card-based layout (rounded corners, drop shadows).

Left Sidebar: Navigation ‚Üí Dashboard, Upload, Risk Simulation, Fraud Detector.

Main Area:

DPR Summary (Auto-generated).

Quality Score Gauge (radial chart).

Risk Flags (traffic-light indicators).

Interactive GIS Map (Leaflet/Mapbox).

Fraud Heatmap (PDF preview with red highlights).

Risk Simulation Page: Slider inputs for cost, timeline, resources ‚Üí AI updates projections dynamically.

Accessibility: Support for multilingual summaries (English, Hindi, Assamese).

üîπ Backend APIs

/upload ‚Üí Upload and parse DPR.

/score ‚Üí Return AI Quality Score + Explainable reasons.

/map ‚Üí Return geospatial risk data.

/fraud-check ‚Üí Return plagiarism/duplication highlights.

/simulate ‚Üí Run predictive risk simulation.

üîπ Additional Requirements

Offline functionality: Cache data for use in low-connectivity areas.

Voice-enabled assistant (optional): Reads summary in Hindi/Assamese.

Code must be clean, modular, and documented.

Must run without any errors on first execution.

Include seed dummy DPR data for demo purposes.
